# Wedding Application
This is my final project, finishing my participation in "Back-end: Python" course in CodersLab School of programming.
---

## Why this project?
I created this app, due to my wedding celebration which is taking place this year. This version should help us to collect infos about our guests and enable our guests to know everything about our celebration.

## Getting started
Before you run the app you should:
- run or create your virtual environment,
- go to the destination, where you want this app to run
- clone this repo by copying its URL and putting it into a "git clone" command
